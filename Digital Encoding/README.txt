Instructions:
	1. Choose your input type. (Defaults to Binary String)
	   If you check the binary string radio button, you must enter   only '1's or '0's into the input box. 
	   If you type anything else, it will yell at you until you backspace and enter valid input.
	   If you check the text string radio button, you can enter anything into the input box.
	   Then, the 'Convert' button will appear. This converts the input into a binary string.

	2. Choose the encoding scheme you would like to graph from the combo box. (Defaults to NRZL)

	3. After the user has entered valid input, the 'Graph' button will appear.
	   Click the 'Graph' button and your output will appear.

	4. If the output extends the bounds of the windows form, expand the window to the right.
